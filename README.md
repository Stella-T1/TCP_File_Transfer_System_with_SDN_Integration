# TCP_File_Transfer_System_with_SDN_Integration
This project presents a reliable TCP-based file transfer system that integrates Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to optimize network traffic. Key features include chunked data transmission with error detection and recovery, cryptographic data verification, and SDN-enabled dynamic flow control implemented through Mininet and Ryu controllers.
